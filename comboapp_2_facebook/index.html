							<p>Once   your app has been released on the App Store we will actively promote it   to interested audience across a multitude of web based media channels   help expand awareness surrounding it and increase general consumer   interest in learning more about the app with the ultimate goal of   increasing downloads and sales. While we utilize time tested effective   marketing efforts to complete this campaign, such as writing and   developing press releases, we also believe that stimulating positive   word-of-mouth to qualitative appeal is important to position our   promoted apps for success. To do this, we will generate positive iTunes   reviews as well as positive app reviews throughout various popular media   forums so that prospective customers are not only alerted to an app's   availability but are alerted to it exceptional quality as well. To   effectively complete this marketing plan our team will:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Create   and distribute a professionally written Press Release extolling the   app's features, usefulness, and other redeeming qualities.</li>
								<li>Aggregate   positive iTunes App Reviews by Independent reviewers, who will publish   them directly onto the Apple App Store (10+ reviews).</li>
								<li>We   will submit our client's apps to at least 50 unique Review Websites to   give it the greatest levels of visibility on these media outlets.</li>

							<p>Establishing   long-lived success is important for apps striving to break through into   the mainstream. Yet, we appreciate how difficult that initial success   is to find on the App Store. That's why ComboApp's marketing teams will   use every resource at their disposal to guarantee   your app finds a place in at least one of Apple's TOP 100 categories,   where millions have the chance to notice it. Our teams will do   everything from drawing on our many media contacts to analyzing your   app's target consumers and developing an effective pricing strategy. The   final result is a marketing plan thats uniquely tailored to push your   app into the TOP 100.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Simply   put, this is our most kinetic marketing plan. It usually produces   measurable results within three days. And, since this is a 'guaranteed result'   package, if we fail to get you into a TOP 100 category you'll   immediately be refunded half of your $4900 investment as consolation.   Now, just so you know, our marketing board analyzes every app's chances   of breaking into one of Apple's TOP 100 categories on a case by case   basis. If we feel this marketing plan is unlikely to help a given app we   will not go through with it out of fairness to our clients. In this   event client be refunded their entire investment, no questions asked.</p>
