							<h1>Mobile Development Teams in our Nearshore and Offshore Development Centres</h1>
							<script>Core.include('modules/departmentsSubMenu')</script>
							<p class="fs16">Mobility is the mainstay where technology, communications, people and businesses now reside.  INTERSOG has been developing mobile apps for more than 5 years, producing and publishing over 300 apps to iTunes, Google Play, Blackberry Apps World and Windows 8 markets</p>
							<article class="columns">
								<p>One key reason we win new business is because of the additional input we provide with our clients’ ideas.  At INTERSOG, we analyze our clients’ vision and product specifications and offer suggestions on potential improvements that help them to stay ahead of the competition, leverage device features and bring uniqueness and magnetism to the user experiences.  We help clients understand what is going to make the app “sticky” and not fall prey to the negative retention statistic or future shelf-ware.</p> 
								<p>We also assist with identifying the required ideal platform coverage for mobile development, functionality options, hosting requirements, app evolution, optimized retention, enterprise or app store deployment, desired analytics, and much more!  By leveraging our offshore development centers in the Ukraine, we deliver reasonably priced custom mobile apps that address operational efficiency or marketing/education challenges with strong impact and justifiable ROI!</p>

Leverage our reusable framework of functional modules for fixed-bid project services or engage a team of needed skills.  We can provide project support with highly qualified mobile (iOS and Android) or web (LAMP, HTML5, C++) frontend/backend developers and UI designers.</p>
