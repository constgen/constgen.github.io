            <h3>“MockUp” Screen Creation</h3>

                On the development stage of games production we also create “mock-up” screens which are much simpler and less pretentious than actual ones. “Mock-Up” screens help to visualize the game and provide the initial idea and understanding of how it will look in the future. “Mock-Up” screens also can be useful for presenting the future application to client’s investor, partners, etc.
