				<h1><img src="images/bg_about.png" width="300" height="42" alt="Who, How, & Why:"></h1>
				<p>digi117 is a mobile marketing agency built from the ground up to offer full-cycle client solutions that have the power to push brands into the mobile arena. We specialize in guiding projects from idea to execution regardless of their scope, and we execute them with a level of industry engagement that produces unprecedented results.</p>
				<p>Our many services are shaped by their integration with social media platforms, gaming media fountains, and location-based consumer engagement outlets. From app co-branding campaigns and video advertising, to mobile web solutions and branded app development, digi117 knows where to access the mobile community and how to captivate them.</p>
				<p>Our ability to break brands, products, and businesses through into the mobile limelight is the biggest single asset we offer our clients. The tactics our teams have expertise in allow digi117 to achieve results at a fraction of the cost non-focused marketing teams normally need. Simply put, our experience within the mobile environment makes outreach on any scale viable and achievable.</p>	
				<p>Co-headquartered in both Chicago and Vancouver, our clients have come in every shape and size. They range from grassroots app developers, to globally recognizable corporations like Morton Salt, and top tier educational establishments like the University of Michigan. The one thing that ties them all together is a shared desire to make an indelible footprint within the mobile landscape, and it's something we're passionate about helping them do.</p>
				<p><strong>Why 117?</strong></p>
				<p>Many of our clients wonder where our name digi117 comes from. Everyone can deduce that "digi" stands for digital, but what about the "117"?</p>
				<p>In the year 2010, the year we began, a new chemical element was discovered in Russia by a joint US-Russian collaboration. This element was given the atomic number 117. Being based in the United States, with principals from that part of the world, we decided it would be fitting to take on 117 as the number to describe a cutting-edge new company and contribution to the digital world, digi117.</p>	
				<p><strong>From inception to execution, we're ready to introduce you into the mobile arena.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>We're digi117.</strong></p>

				<div class="description">
					<p>Max is a writer and creative strategist with experience spanning across multiple areas of business. Initially establishing himself as a technical writer and researcher within the IT industry, his experience with creative writing and design served as a catalyst to start building up a copywriting portfolio centered around creative marketing and advertising content. Years of eclectic experience writing everything from stories to mobile app content taught Max that great content is never one-dimensional – that
great technical work never lacks elements of creativity, or visa versa. It's an axiom he brings with him to digi117.</p>
