						<h2>Morton Salt Pro</h2><br>
						<p><strong>About  the company</strong></p>
						<p>Morton Salt, Inc., a Chicago-based company  continuing a Morton Salt business dating back to 1848, is North America's  authority on salt and a leading producer of salt for grocery, water softening,  ice control, agricultural, and industrial uses. Morton introduced the nation to  the Morton Umbrella Girl and the now-famous slogan, &quot;When It Rains It  Pours&quot; in 1914. Since that time, Morton Salt products have graced the  shelves of more homes throughout the country than any other brand of salt.</p>
						<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
						<p>Morton Salt, Inc. approached digi117 to  create a mobile application to help snow professionals manage selection and  usage of Morton&rsquo;s complete line of professional ice melting products.  The primary goal of the application was to  utilize scientific research to identify the optimal Morton ice melter and  application rate for specific environmental conditions and surface area.  The app would essentially help snow  professionals save time by (by recommending products that work faster in given  conditions) and save money (by reducing melter over-application).</p>
						<p><strong>Result</strong></p>
						<p>Based on our client&rsquo;s requests, digi117&rsquo;s  team of professional developers created the Morton Salt Pro application that  takes input on external temperature conditions and surface area to identify the  most suitable ice melting product and application rate for the snow  professionals&rsquo; job. The application allows users to store and track site  information and also provides application guidance for &ldquo;non-optimal&rdquo; melters in  the event the snow professional does not have the app recommended melter  available.  The application makes it  easier for snow professionals to plan for snow events, and helps ensure  consumer safety by highlighting application rates and products that most  effectively keep sidewalks, driveways and steps clear of ice and snow.  </p>
						<p><strong>App  Features: </strong></p>
						<p>- Customizable work site catalog <br>
							- Site detail histories including location  and area<br>
							- Calculator to identify ice melter &amp;  quantity required<br>
							- Air/ surface temperature logging <br>
							- Work site surface area logging <br>
							- Product recommendation capability <br>
							- Morton Salt ice melting product library</p>
						<p>Morton Salt Pro is compatible with iPhone,  iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. It&rsquo;s a free application available for  download on the Apple App Store and Android Market. There is also a desktop  calculator tool available at <a href="http://www.mortonmelters.com">www.mortonmelters.com</a> for stationary use.</p>

The end result of this work was the creation of The Forest Preserve  District of Cook County&rsquo;s application, in both iOS and BlackBerry compatible  variations. The application&rsquo;s central functionalities include providing users  with information about Cook County Forest Preserve District&rsquo;s many facilities,  assets, and events. For user convenience, accessing the application&rsquo;s vast  array of contents is done by navigating and reviewing dynamic, location-based  maps, and categorized informational sections. </p>

These include conducting searches by region, activity, or event, or by  selecting any one of the many push-pin icons present on the application&rsquo;s  interactive maps. Data for each location is presented on a separate screen and  includes a short description, as well as contact information for the given  event or location, driving directions, and photos.  Activity and Region search functions allow users to locate specified areas of  interest, such as &ldquo;Hiking&rdquo;, &ldquo;Golfing&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fishing&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nature center&rdquo;, etc. </p>

						<h2>World Academy Online </h2><br>
						<p><strong>About the company</strong></p>
						<p>ComboApp  is a mobile content publishing and marketing group. From acquiring content to  publishing and successful marketing solutions, ComboApp is committed to providing app  solutions for emerging mobile technologies and enthusiastic about future  expansion within this burgeoning industry. The company has brought over 300  mobile apps to market for every major smart-phone platform including iPhone,  iPad, Android and BlackBerry. ComboApp also actively promotes applications for  the Mac App Store, Apple's innovative new laptop/desktop app marketplace.</p>
						<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
						<p>As a digital  publishing group, ComboApp aims to differentiate itself from conventional  publishing companies both in its operations as well as its approach to  publishing as a whole. Starting with authored content, we set goal for  ourselves: To create complete Learning Systems in the form of mobile  applications had the capability to succeed at delivering practical educational  solutions across every major mobile platform. These applications were created  to assist people in studying professional fields ranging from business to  finance. In order to carry out this ambitious and immensely challenging project  - &ldquo;World Academy Online&rdquo; - ComboApp employed digi117&rsquo;s professional team.  Digi117&rsquo;s task was to execute a wide range of full-cycle mobile strategies and  solutions to connect customers with their education in new and innovative ways.</p>
						<p><strong>Result</strong></p>
						<p>Digi117&rsquo;s dedicated  efforts helped develop the World Academy Online brand from two independent  educational systems created specifically for the mobile marketplace – ComboBook™  and Learning To-Go™.</p>
						<p>ComboBook™ represents a revolutionary new system for  self-education. This system creates a user-directed, interactive educational  system from any content without requiring preexisting flashcards, tests or  other study aides. It functions by converting stagnant text into dynamic and  interactive education. The basic principle is as follows: students read a  section of the text and before proceeding to the next section, they are asked a  series of questions that could include various types of tests. These tests  include: putting words in the right order, filling in the blanks within a short  paragraph, finishing a statement with the proper variation or true/false  questions. This learning system utilizes innovative new methods to analyze any  authored content and use it as a base to generate spontaneous study tools,  ultimately transforming content into and engaging and interactive experience  that is suitable for self-educational purposes. </p>
						<p><strong>ComboBook Applications  Feature:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Outline functionality.</li>
							<li>In-app content search.</li>
							<li>Page flip animation.</li>
							<li>Adaptive test generation capability.</li>
							<li>Comprehensive text analysis  capability.</li>
							<li>Text formatting functionality.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Learning To-Go™ is a single-source learning solution. This is  a mobile educational system designed to encourage and enable independent study  of original, authored material. Learning To-Go titles are both informative and  affordable, providing users with a well-integrated, flexible learning  experience which they can utilize on the go from anywhere and at any time.  There are three primary categories in these innovative learning systems:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Text- In the form of articles with  graphs, tables, formulas, pictures etc.</li>
							<li>Flash Cards - Available for every  chapter to help learn and test the material</li>
							<li>Tests - For every chapter there is a  set of questions to test students' retention of material</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Combining text, flashcards, and self-tests, each Learning  To-Go title creates a completely user-controlled educational experience. The  system tracks students&rsquo; retention of material and reports back to them with a  visual progress chart. Upon completion users will also have a solid understanding  of the many important market influences and economic conditions that affect  modern business and finance environments. More importantly, they will have  gained real-world knowledge to identify and implement the strategies they have  learned in order to achieve success in their own careers.</p>
						<p><strong>Learning To-Go Applications Feature:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Full course text divided by chapter.</li>
							<li>Interactive flashcards for subject  review.</li>
							<li>Comprehensive chapter level tests.</li>
							<li>Explanation of right and wrong  answers.</li>
							<li>Comprehensive chapter level tests.</li>
							<li>A bookmark.</li>
							<li>A glossary.</li>
							<li>Offline access to material, no  internet connection required.</li>
						</ul>

Over 300,000 Enneagram Personality Full Tests  have already been sold around the world in Chinese, Dutch, English, French,  German, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.

						<h2>3D Coloring Book for Kids </h2><br>
						<p><strong>About  the company</strong></p>
						<p>ComboApp  is a mobile content publishing and marketing group. From acquiring content to  publishing and successful marketing solutions, ComboApp is committed to providing app  solutions for emerging mobile technologies and enthusiastic about future  expansion within this burgeoning industry. The company has brought over 300  mobile apps to market for every major smart-phone platform including iPhone,  iPad, Android and BlackBerry. ComboApp also actively promotes applications for  the Mac App Store.</p>
						<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
						<p>ComboApp takes pride  in being a company that provides a diverse array of mobile applications for  different target groups, catering to both adult and child users alike. On this  note, one of ComboApp&rsquo;s continuously expanding mobile projects is the development  of a series of kids&rsquo; applications that provide both entertainment and hold  educational value. This collection of applications – the 3D Coloring Book for  Kids collection – would allow children to color an array of differently themed  images on their mobile devices, developing their artistic abilities in a  dynamic, fun and easily accessible way. Unlike regular coloring apps, ComboApp  was driven to create an artistic app that would allow its users the freedom to roam  through a 3D canvas and freely color in classic pre-designed figures. Unlike  traditional coloring apps that simply mimicked the experience of coloring in  pages in a book, ComboApp&rsquo;s &ldquo;3D&rdquo; series would open up a whole virtual world for  children to explore and give color to.</p>
						<p>To turn this concept into  a reality, ComboApp turned to its subsidiary - digi117. This company had a  wealth of experience in successfully bringing complex mobile application  concepts to fruition. </p>
						<p><strong>Result</strong></p>
						<p>Digi117&rsquo;s team of professional  developers set about building the framework that would become the basis of  ComboApp&rsquo;s 3D Coloring Book for Kids series. Their efforts culminated in the  creation and subsequent successful release of the original 3D Coloring Book for  Kids application. As of today the series includes 9 applications, each of which  are compatible with the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. This application franchise  includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>3D  Coloring Book for Kids: Seasons</li>
							<li>3D  Coloring Book for Kids: Pets</li>
							<li>3D  Coloring Book for Kids: The Gift</li>
							<li>3D  Coloring Book for Kids: Fantasy Girls</li>
							<li>3D  Coloring Book for Kids: World</li>
							<li>3D  Coloring Book for Kids: Winter</li>
							<li>3D  Coloring Book for Kids: Christmas</li>
							<li>Paint  Me 3D: Airplanes</li>
							<li>Coloring  Mix 3D (includes Winter, Fantasy Girls, Pets and Airplanes themes)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The 3D Coloring Book  series found success on the App Store because it offered users something that  they hadn&rsquo;t experienced before. Young artists were given the freedom to explore  art and personal expression more deeply than was available in other more typical  coloring apps. The series&rsquo; pre-drawn 3D outlines of everything from house,  girls, pets, and other themes ensure that even the most inexperienced of  children can effectively create fluid and beautiful illustrations. As little  artists color in various portions of Coloring Book&rsquo;s canvas, changing hues and  shading effects are automatically added to create a realistic three dimensional  appearance.</p>
						<p>With a remarkably  diverse and useful set of features, the 3D Coloring Book series was able to  maximize the freedom with which users could color in the virtual objects of  their choice. Apps even give users the ability to insert a variety of  animations to their newly drawn illustrations. </p>
						<p>All  above mentioned applications are compatible with the iPhone, iPad and iPod  Touch, and are available for download on the Apple App Store.</p>

						<h2>Hippie Hippo </h2><br>
						<p><strong>About  the company</strong></p>
						<p>INTERSOG is an international company  with an extensive expertise in mobile application development targeted towards  a wide range of existing platforms and markets. The company entered the mobile  development industry in early 2007 and quickly asserted itself as a leading  application developer in this highly competitive environment.

INTERSOG  specializes in complete product life cycles that utilize a partnership approach  to client engagements and focuses on emerging technologies for a full range of  cutting-edge IT development services and turnkey solutions.</p>
						<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
						<p>Paying tribute to those customers who  use their mobile devices not only for everyday communication and business  matters, but for an entertainment as well, INTERSOG decided to develop a funny  and engaging mobile game that would be interesting to people of all ages. With  such a goal in mind INTERSOG turned to its subsidiary digi117 – a company with  extensive experience in developing unique and attractive mobile applications from  scratch – to create a mobile game that was as visually breathtaking as it was  engaging and rewarding to play. </p>
						<p><strong>Result</strong></p>
						<p>Digi117&rsquo;s team of professional  developers took on the challenge of creating Hippie Hippo, guiding the project  from its initial conceptual stage to its final execution, producing a vividly  rendered arcade style action-strategy game for iOS that could compete at the  highest levels of the Apple App Store&rsquo;s gaming market. Hippie Hippo is an  addicting arcade adventure that blends together vibrantly rendered cartoon  imagery with fast paced action, and strategically minded gameplay into one  entertaining package. Players are thrown into the shoes –  or more accurately skates – of Hippie the Hippo as he charges through the  arctic pushing every foe off of the ice into the frigid ocean without  accidentally skating or being bumped into the water himself. For ease of play,  users are provided with descriptions of each level and quick &lsquo;level repeat&rsquo;  options as well. Frustrated gamers can even unlock levels they can&rsquo;t beat by  simply buying a level pass via in-app purchase. </p>
						<p><strong>General  game features include:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>60 unique and diverse levels</li>
							<li>Short level descriptions</li>
							<li>Dynamic graphics</li>
							<li>Powerful realistic physics engine</li>
							<li>Game Score statistics and histories</li>
							<li>Opportunity to buy the 1-level  passes via in-app purchase.</li>
							<li>Original game soundtrack<br>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Hippie Hippo is compatible with the iPhone,  iPad and iPod Touch, and is available for download on the  Apple App Store.</p>

						genuine marketing or business challenges. It's a belief that has served her <br>
						well, and one she's brought on board as a hallmark of her tenure at digi117. <br>
						With an unbounded passion for creativity, Margaret can be found <br>
						creating art and writing music when she's not <br>
						negotiating projects with our clients.
