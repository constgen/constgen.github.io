				<p>At Intersog we believe that exploring, understanding, and visualizing a project is fundamental to executing it successfully. That's why, after creating an estimate and task list for the project, we'll carefully create interactive prototypes for it.  After these prototypes are developed, we'll meet with our customers to discuss any changes. Once our prototype is multi-lateral finalized, it becomes the foundation which our developers work from and build upon. To create our prototypes and interfaces, our UI designers and analysts use Axure Pro, Omni Graffle, MS Visio and several internet services such as iPlotz and iRize. We are always open to new ideas and concepts so the participation and feedback of the client are highly appreciated.</p>
				<p>When the mock-up creation is completed and our customer is satisfied with the results, our analysts create the project specifications. The approach for creating specifications is to simplify our understanding and boost the development process, so we usually create high-level user-scenarios for the project. They also use Scrum as our preferred project management methodology.</p>
