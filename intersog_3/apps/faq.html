			<h5>How to start with your idea</h5>
			<div class="pane"><div>
				<p>	If you have a great idea that you'd like to use as the basis of an application the first thing you need to consider is who your target audience will be and business model you'll utilize to monetize your app. Based on this information, you will be able to select the ideal platform(s) for your future project and decide from there whether you will develop your app specifically for the iPhone,iPad, Android, or Blackberry platform -- or if you'll develop your app across multiple platforms. This decision will affect the development price, development speed, which type of graphic resources will be required for development. After this you should draft a comprehensive outline of your application idea and it's proposed functionality. It is always greatly beneficial to us if you create functional app specifications, a concise description, together with a clear visual representation of how you envision your application will look like.</p>
	
					<p>You can outsource these tasks or limit your direct involvement to one of the aforementioned steps and let our development team deal with the rest. However, without a clear understanding of your project objectives and your app's functionality the analytical stage of development will last much longer. Furthermore various development and implementation risks will be eventually be much higher and the development process as a whole will require much more effort and attention from both sides.</p>
					
					<p>Make sure that you set realistic budgetary parameters for your project and get accurate quotes from the development companies you approach to critique against your planned budget. Please remember that if you set a fixed budget for development vendors may suggest that you exclude some features or functionalities from your application to ensure that it's development fits your budget.
					</p>
					<p>To hire a professional development company you will need to ask a lot of questions about their business operations and look closely at development process descriptions. Always ask yourself critical questions like: Do they have enough experience to meet my needs?</p>
					
					<p>Check the portfolio of the vendor and revise graphics, user-interface, and overall quality. Request to test one their completed products before you whether or not to hire them. After you've made your final decision you should provide as many details about your project as possible and establish communication channels with your chosen developer that is convenient, open, reliable, and effective.</p>
					
					<p>Don't forget to sign a full non-disclosure agreement (NDA) prior to beginning any development work. This measure will protect your intellectual property rights and establish a formally confidential tone for all future communications.</p>
					
					<p>Be precise about what development timeline you expect to follow, as well as what functionalities you expect to be delivered or completed first. It's very important to let your development company know about your future business plans and deadline expectations as it will help them create a concrete project management plan and allow them to set specific milestones for progressing through your project. Be sure to communicate these business plans and your timeline together with your expectations in written form prior to the start of project development to maintain maximum clarity on both ends.</p>
					
					<p>Once development begins, prepare yourself to work through a large amount of different iterations, bugs, and questions from developers that need answering. These are things which are invariably present in any development project, remember that if bugs are found at the development stage it's much better than discovering them after your application launches to the public. This form trail-and-error development will lead ultimately lead to more profits and higher customer satisfaction with your end product. To ensure that this happens though, you'll need to stay involved throughout the whole development process from beginning to end. Always remember, its your application. Also realize that after your project's scope is settled upon, all additional functionalities that you would like to include will be charged an extra premium over the project's original budget.</p>
					
					<p>We recommend that you create a specific payment structure for your project's development, for example: Offer milestone payments with 25% of project cost paid to begin development, another 25% paid after first your app's first version is completed, another 25% after the beta version is completed, and the remaining 25% at the end of the project when your app is fully done.</p>

				<h3>Balsamiq mock-ups</h3>
				<p>If you are wondering about how to create a mobile application   prototype don't wasting a lot of money and time - you're on the right   page. Here we will review a set of great tools that will help you to do   this without useless effort. The first quick and powerful tool that we   would like to share with you is called the Balsmiq Mock-up, which can be   accessed at <a href="http://balsamiq.com/">http://balsamiq.com/</a> This tool reproduces the experience of whiteboard sketching using your   browser. From here you can easily share and modify final screens.   Wire-frames made via Balsamiq mock-up will look like sketches which is   great to show the draft character of your mock-up without distract your   project's user interface and design teams with unnecessary details. With   Balsamiq you will also be able to plan the mechanics of how an app   should work, and visually see its flow from one action to another.</p>
				<div><img src="http://apps.intersog.com/images/stories/img/tmp/image03.png" alt="" border="0"></div>
				<h3>iPlotz mock-ups</h3>
				<p>It's very important to provide your development team with graphical   resources that they can start working from. Of course, if you're working   with a serious development vendor you can skip this step and require it   as part of the initial project scope. That said, an initial screen   draft could prove very helpful for reference before any development   contracts and agreements are signed. These screens will help the   development team start with the right conceptual foundation and   subsequently be more precise and careful when creating the final mock-up   version. These are the primary reasons sketching wire frames is such a   valuable technique for eliciting requirements, and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iplotz.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFIJMeYxnXMwf66PRl17oN0LrZ51A">iPlotz</a> is exactly right tool to create them with.</p>
				<p>iPlotz offers users a browser based application where they can   quickly prototype their application screens. You can download this   application as well if needed. iPlotz enables users to use stencils and   highlight navigation between pages as well. Using it's straightforward   interface, you will be able to visualize your application idea in a   matter of minutes.</p>
				<div><img src="http://apps.intersog.com/images/stories/img/tmp/image00.jpg" alt="" border="0"></div>
				<p>If you prefer to work offline or don't want to use a fancy web 2.0   tool for mock-up creation, you can simply utilize MockApp. This utility   that enables you to download Keynote and PowerPoint templates, which are   very handy for creating small non-complicated mock-ups.</p>
				<div><a href="http://mockapp.com/download/"><img src="http://apps.intersog.com/images/stories/img/tmp/image01.png" alt="" border="0"></a></div>
				<p>In either case though, if you decide to hire a professional designer   to complete these mock-up tasks, you can provide them with the following   useful and time-saving resources.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/?p=1628">Adobe Photo-Shop template for mock-up creation</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://blog.metaspark.com/2009/02/fireworks-toolkit-for-creating-iphone-ui-mockups/">Adobe Fireworks template for mock-up creation</a></li>
					<li>It may also prove useful for you to review the original iPhone Human Interface guidelines from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/PartII/PartII.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH9-SW1">Apple when you are creating your initial app mock-ups</a>.</li>

			<h5>How to prepare graphics for iPhone apps?</h5>
			<div class="pane"><div>
				<p>This is a guideline for Intersog clients on how to prepare the   graphics you'd like us to develop for your iPhone applications. Please   follow guideline as it will help to save time for both you as a client   as well as for us as developers.</p>
				<h6>Size</h6>
				<p>In some cases (such as splash screens, game backgrounds, etc.) we   will need to utilize full size images. In other cases (such as with   moving elements, app buttons, etc.) we'll only need graphics with   resolutions large enough for these elements (containing no background as   they are only the size of the element itself and NOT at full-screen   resolution) - this said they should still be developed at a 1:1 ratio as   PNGs with the proper transparency and alpha channel.</p>
				<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples:</em></p>
				<div class="info">
					<p>A moon image moving across the sky - for this example we will need   to produce a 480 x 320 pixel background image + 1 image of the moon (1:1   size, cropped to the correct size) with an alpha channel and a   transparent background.</p>
					<p>A button with a highlight effect (or a small animated element) - for   this we will need the images for each different state of this element    will be in. We  produce this with a 1:1 ratio, cropped to size, with a   transparent background and the same positioning. (i.e. different states   of the singe object are each cropped in the same way as differently   positioned states in relation to the top left corner of the image will   cause unwanted jumping or moving effects.)</p>
				</div>
				<h6>Format and compression</h6>
				<p>Usually it's better to use PNG images during development. We advise   you to use the lowest number of colors and lowest image quality that you   find acceptable. For example, usually it's not necessary to utilize 256   colors for any single PNG image - we can save valuable space by using   only 128 colors instead. To note though, you should always check all   images to ensure that you are still happy with how the look.</p>
				<h6>Positioning</h6>
				<p>All animated elements supplied as a series of images should have the   same positioning - i.e. their distance from the same 'zero point' - such   as the top left corner of the image - should be the same unless you   want it to jump or move around on-screen.</p>
				<h6>Transparency</h6>
				<p>For non-background elements (such as buttons, characters, etc.),   please check that your images have a transparent background and that its   alpha channel enabled (for PNG images).</p>
				<h6>File names</h6>
				<p>Please organize file names and folders so that it's easy to   understand which elements go where and which are images represent   different frames of the same element. When sending the new versions of   these same files, please take care to keep the file names the same as   well (please remove extraneous labels such as "copy" or "copy 2" which   are added by automatically Adobe Photoshop).</p>
				<h6>3D and OpenGL</h6>
				<p>As a rule, the sizes of all OpenGL textures should be in multiples of   2. Keeping this in mind, when sending graphics for 3D objects please   make ensure that their sizes are in multiples of 2 (4 x 4, 8 x 8, 256 x   256, 1024 x 1024, etc.).</p>
				<h6>Fonts</h6>
				<p>Here you may check which fonts are system standard for iPhone SDK and   therefore could be displayed most pragmatically. We won't need to spend   undue time creating graphics for text if you choose to utilize one of   these fonts.</p>
				<p>The following is a list of iPhone SDK supported fonts:</p>

			</div></div>
			
			<h5>How can you guarantee success of the projects?</h5>
			<div class="pane"><div>
				<p>Success of the project is granted because of the properly set up   Agile development methodology which helps us to avoid potential   problems. Here are main problems and solutions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lack of time for project completion. Because of short iterations   catch up with the arrears becomes clear and manageable task. Due to   flexible software development process we are always able to add   additional team members and amplify the team. Otherwise all the required   corrections are submitted for client endorsement to ensure tasks   completion according to the schedule.</li>
					<li>Technical difficulties. Owing to our extensive experience and high   professionalism we usually don't meet any unpredicted technical problem.   However such problems can show up from time to time and if this happens   - it happens on early stages of development thanks to accurate and   comprehensive testing. This testing helps us to resolve major percentage   of technical issues before the project due date.</li>
					<li>Discrepancy in the understanding of the tasks. Due to continuous   interactions with development team and client who see results frequently   starting from the first builds such type of problems can be eliminated   and detected rapidly at early stages of development process.</li>
