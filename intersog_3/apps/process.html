					<li>Features selection and discussion with the client. Rough estimates of work content and expected velocity are done.</li>
					<li>At the first day of the sprint we arrange a Sprint Planning Meeting to detect tasks that will be included in the iteration where we create sub-tasks and plan out the tickets for our project management system called Redmine.</li>				
					<li>First week of the sprint will generally be devoted to the implementation of new features while our QA and analysis teams are preparing the necessary documentation for the next sprint and testing sessions.</li>				
					<li>The second week will be dedicated to testing and debugging, and our QA engineers, analysts, and developers will tightly cooperate with one another to maintain a stable and operational build of the application.</li>				
					<li>At the end of the iteration a Sprint Review/Retrospective meeting will take place where our team as well as our clients discuss their results and additional quality assurance criteria are figured in as well.</li>				
					<li>Our Agile approach and scrum-based methodology are outstanding tools which help us to deploy working application prototypes soon as possible, always emphasizing client feedback, high development quality, as well as cost-effectiveness.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<p>We believe that every stage of our projects are equally important to execute effectively to ensure positive outcomes, and we take a lot of effort to execute each step of development correctly. However, it's very difficult to manage projects without proper documentation and that's why the analysis stage, which includes user experience insurance, application prototyping, and documentation creation, remains one of the most important stages for correctly starting most projects. In the beginning we bring together interactive mock-ups, prototypes whose main goal is to form the design and navigation bases, and to make your application feel and look great at completion. Our analysis and QA teams will work with our clients to figure out their target user's needs and preferences, and create the most valuable outcome accordingly. As a client, you can expect the creation of user stories or 'use-cases', as well as prototyping and wire frame development at this stage. This won't be a polished graphic user interface quite yet, but only draft to get first impressions and to help our clients to start forming more informed opinions about their project. This stage is very important for the project's future in general, and its a stage that's never underestimated at Intersog.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<p>After the final planning and documentation aspects of your project are complete, we begin coding. We utilize Scrum and Agile practices so that the development process is divided into separate periods with shorter time-frames called sprints. Each sprint usually takes around two weeks of pure development, with an analysis stage that starts at the end of each iteration. During this stage our analysis and QA teams create all the necessary artifacts and documentation, such as user stories and test-cases. The integration phase is often only begun at the very end of a sprint cycle and may last up to one week.</p>

					<p>Utilizing our experience in application development as well as the promotion of our own product catalog, the Intersog team would be glad to provide not only the aforementioned services but also publishing and marketing services with the help of our strategic partner - the ComboApp Marketing & PR Agency.</p>
					<p>Being part of the iPhone Developer Program, we at Intersog have immediate access to our App Store account and this means that you don't need to apply for membership when releasing content to the App Store if you don't want to. We'll take care of it by ourselves and will make sure deployment is completed smoothly and the content is promptly released to countless iPhone users from around the world. However, we realize that a lot our our customers might desire to become members of the iPhone Developer Program themselves, in which case we'll gladly help in opening this account and submitting an application as well.</p>
					<p>Besides the iOS marketplace we also utilize market distribution software for Android platforms including their official Google market, and would be happy to grant your application access to this market via our software as well. The good news is that you won't need to wait very long for application approval and publishing moderation. In a matter of days your application will be ready for sale.</p>
					<p>Of course, we are also able to help our clients submit their applications to the RIM and W7 marketplaces as well, as we've had a number of projects developed for these platforms as well.</p>
