									<hr>A top flight digital marketing agency needs a web site as fresh as the marketing solutions it offers. As ComboApp's resident Web Master, Betty ensures that this is always the case. With a background as an established website administrator and web designer, she embodies the definition of practical creativity. Betty's expertise in online maintenance is no laughing matter, unlike the barrage of hilarity she brings with her to the office everyday. She loves cats too, which we presume is because - much unlike the realities of web management - they're cute, cuddly, and predictable.
