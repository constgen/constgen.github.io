			{id:'safepets', title:'KEEPING PETS SAFE THIS WINTER', text:'<p>Walking in a winter wonderland can be hazardous for our four-legged friends. "The winter months can be a very dangerous and uncomfortable period for pets," says Dr. Sharon Gwaltney-Brant, a veterinarian and board-certified toxicologist. With the help of Dr. Gwaltney-Brant, Morton Salt, Inc. provides a few tips for keeping your pets safe this snowy season:</p>\
					<ul>\
						<li>Remember Their Tags – Dogs may love to frolic in the snow, but they can easily lose their scent and become lost in all that white. More dogs go missing in the winter than any other season, so keep them on a leash and ensure they are always wearing an ID tag.</li>\
						<li>Protect Those Paws – The salted sidewalks and streets are very hard on pets\' paws – but there is a solution. Morton<sup>®</sup> Safe-T-Pet<sup>®</sup>, developed with veterinarians, is a salt free and chloride free ice melter which melts below 15 degrees Fahrenheit. Its urea-based, organic formula is non-toxic and non-irritating to pet\'s paws and stomachs. Some other ice melters on the market mislead consumers regarding how well the product melts and how safe the product is. For example, when testing was conducted by Michigan Technological University Keweenah Snow Research Center, the Safe Paw<sup>®</sup> ice melt product did not melt snow and ice at sub-zero temperatures as claimed. Other brands claim to be pet-safe but actually contain chlorides which can be harmful to pets digestive systems if ingested and which can be painful or irritating to pets\' paws. So make sure you look for a chloride free melter from a company you can trust to validate claims and put safety first. </li>\
						<li>Avoid Toxic Temptations – The sweet taste of antifreeze solution is attractive to pets, but is highly toxic even in the smallest amounts. Be sure to keep all chemicals sealed on a high shelf, away from your furry friends, and clean up spills as soon as they happen. </li>\
						<li>Winter Weight, Be Gone – Just like humans, animals are less active in the winter and don\'t burn as many calories. Keep your pets healthy by reducing their diet to avoid winter weight gain. Speak with your veterinarian about proper diets during "hibernation" season.</li>\
						<li>Warm Home, Cold Floors – It is important to remember that although your home may be warm, there may still be drafty areas. Make sure your pets have something soft to sleep on (away from drafts) to protect them from the cold floor.</li>\
						<li>Holiday Treats for Humans Only – When throwing those much anticipated holiday parties, be sure to keep all chocolate, macadamia nuts, alcohol and even mistletoe and holly berries out of reach. Although seemingly harmless –these can be dangerous if ingested by pets. </li>\
						<li>Running Out, Be Back Soon – Do not leave your dog in a car during the winter months. This enclosed space freezes fast, so if you are running errands be sure to leave your pet at home in the warmth of your home or keep them by your side when out and about.</li>\
						<li>Wipe Down To Stop Whining – In addition to selecting a pet-friendly ice melter, be sure to towel off your pet after time outside to remove salt and other irritants from their paws and skin. At the same time, inspect the paw pads for any collection of snow or ice to ward off winter weather problems.</li>\
					</ul>'}, 
			{id:'winterizehome', title:'WINTERIZING YOUR HOME', text:'<p>As temperatures dip and snow flakes start to fall, your home will require extra maintenance to keep it in top notch shape throughout the winter. Here are a few tips from Morton Salt, Inc., the maker of Morton\'s line of specialty ice melter products, to help you prepare your home for cold weather.</p>\
					<ul>\
						<li>Smart Stock Up: Be ready for that first storm. Stock your car and garage with appropriate winter supplies, such as shovels, ice scrapers, ice picks, blankets, and etc. Check any older snow blowers, shovels, and ice scrapers for damage, and replace or repair any that are damaged or worn before the first snowfall. Don\'t forget to keep walkways clear of ice and snow and safe for your family and neighbors by using ice melters! Look for a brand you can trust like Morton, who uses third party or laboratory testing to validate ice melter performance claims. Purchase melters specifically designed to melt in your area\'s climate and that meet your winter needs. From pet safe to extreme weather and fast-acting products, Morton\'s line of ice melters is designed to meet your everyday ice melting needs.</li>\
						<li>Careful Clean Up: The harsh winter weather can be rough on your plants and lawn. Snow, wind, sleet and ice can result in weak tree trunks and broken branches that can damage your house, car, or even worse, someone on your property. When the weather starts to cool, don\'t forget to trim your trees and get rid of dead branches. Also be sure to clean the gutters on your house to prevent water from building up and freezing. Your flowers need to be covered as well, so they are safe and ready for Spring!</li>\
						<li>Homey Heat Up: This may seem like a no-brainer, but always be cognizant of the temperature inside the home, keeping it at least 65 degrees Fahrenheit. If it is any colder, you risk the chance of pipes freezing, which can crack and spew gallons of water throughout your home. Don\'t forget to drain the outdoor hoses as well.</li>\
						<li>Cautious Check Up: Check all doors and windows for cracks or areas where cold air could seep in, using caulk and weatherstripping to fix and prevent this problem. Make sure all steps, handrails, sidewalks and driveways are in good shape. Broken stairs and cracked cement become even more dangerous when covered with snow and ice. All deicers can accelerate surface damage to concrete, since they increase the number of freeze-thaw cycles. In order to prevent additional cracks from forming in good quality concrete due to the use of deicing agents, use an ice melter such as Morton<sup>®</sup> Safe-T-Plus<sup>®</sup> ice melt, which is formulated to result in reduced surface damage to concrete compared to plain salt. This ice melter also contains a blend of active ingredients which can reduce corrosion by 14 percent compared to plain salt.</li>\
						<li>Prepared Pack Up: In the spirit of preparedness, creating a winter emergency kit for both the home and car is an excellent idea. For your home, be sure to have indoor candles, matches and batteries on hand in case of a power shortage. For your car, be sure to have extra blankets, road flares, and a flashlight available in case of a roadside emergency. Write down important phone numbers and tape them inside the kit. You never know how long the power might be out or the emergency might last, so having non-perishable food, water bottles and blankets are essential. A small first aid kit helps with any minor medical emergencies that may arise. Finally, keep a bag of Morton<sup>®</sup> Safe-T-Salt<sup>®</sup> in your trunk to weigh down your car in order to provide additional stability when driving on a slippery road – the extra weight may also help provide traction for getting out of snowdrifts.</li>\
						<li>Protect Neighborhood Paws : The salted sidewalks and streets in the winter can be very hard on pets\' paws, so help keep your four-legged friends safe by using Morton<sup>®</sup> Safe-T-Pet<sup>®</sup>. Developed with veterinarians, Safe-T-Pet<sup>®</sup> is a salt and chloride free ice melter that is non-toxic and non-irritating, making it safer for you and your neighbors\' pets.</li>\

						title:'HOW IT WORKS',
						text:'<p></p>\
						<ul>\
							<li>All deicers (whether salt or a specialty blend) attract moisture to form a liquid brine.</li>\
							<li>The brine melts its surroundings because it has a lower melting point than ice and snow.</li>\
							<li>Typically, smaller ice melt crystals stay at the surface to melt while larger crystals penetrate down to melt on the ground below.</li>\
							<li>As with all deicers, the brine will penetrate concrete. As temperatures drop, the brine may freeze and expand inside the concrete\'s chambers causing surface cracking or spalling.</li>\
							<li>Morton<sup>®</sup> Safe-T-Plus<sup>®</sup> contains HEC which helps create a protective seal on your concrete to keep brine from seeping in, and can reduce corrosion by 14% compared to plain salt.</li>\
							<li>The HEC turns to a powder once the brine is gone and returns to gel form as new ice and snow fall, helping to continue the protection process.</li>\
							<li>TIP: For easier ice and snow removal, apply deicer to pavement before ice and snow accumulate. The brine will prevent snow and ice from bonding with the pavement making it easier to shovel off later.</li>\
						</ul>\
						<h5>PREVENT DAMAGE</h5>\
						<p>All deicers can cause damage to concrete because they increase the number of freeze-thaw cycles. This process occurs because concrete is porous, and the ice melter brine can seep into void spaces. If the temperature drops, the brine can freeze and expand in these spaces, "pushing" the concrete out, causing stress and subsequent cracks in the pavement.<br><br>Important! Newly-laid or poor quality concrete is particularly susceptible to such damage. Use deicer only on properly formulated, cured, air-entrained concrete that is at least one year old. It\'s also best to remove slush from the surface as it melts to help prevent concrete damage.</p>'
