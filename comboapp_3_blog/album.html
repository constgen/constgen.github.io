								<p>Since the launch of the ITunes App store back in summer 2008 iOS developers didn't experience any significant legal patent problems. That remained the case until May 13, 2011, when Lodnys, the in-app purchase patent holder, began to threaten several companies with legal action. These developers had  been informed that they had 21 days to license technology related to in-app purchasing systems. Obviously the news came out of the blue for these developers as up until that moment they had certain minor issues with Apple Inc. related to the rejection of certain apps or app reviewing delays, but nothing on such a serious legal scale <a class="more-link" href="detail.html"><span>More</span> ></a></p>
