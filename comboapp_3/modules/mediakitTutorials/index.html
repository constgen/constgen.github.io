			<h2>Application Icon</h2>
			<p>Let us look at any TOP category list. What do we see? A whole array of applications with varying icons and text. In order to see the description, reviews and screenshots, the App Store user must click on the icon to view that information. What causes users to click on a particular app's icon? In most cases, it is the icon that is most visually pleasing. In fact, an attractive icon is the first step toward increased sales.</p>
			<p>It's impossible to explain in print what makes an icon attractive, but an unappealing icon can actually deter sales, but it is possible to lay out several general recommendations (of course, noting that every rule has its exceptions). For instance, we've noticed that 3D icons generally improve sales. Don't forget that programmers can help the designer. iTunes changes the icon by default. It rounds off corners and puts its "branded" border around the developers icon. But during the design of the application the programmer can turn off these features which can sometimes distort the design. If your programmer doesn't know how to do that, ask Google how it is made.</p>
			<p>Another factor is when the designer shows the prototype of an icon. Often icons look great when displayed in 512x512 pixels, but do not translate when being resized to 57x57 pixels. There should be 2 unique icons! Not simply a large one that is resized. Each should look gorgeous in its own size. Also don't forget about the background where the icon appears. Check the icon in every place where it will be displayed. The designer should show the icon as it will appear to potential customers. It is not difficult to take iTunes screenshots and insert your own icon there, so you can see how it will look prior to launch.</p>
