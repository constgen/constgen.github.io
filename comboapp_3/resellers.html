							<h4>1. Reseller Program</h4>
							<p>ComboApp's Marketing Services Reseller Program is geared towards individuals or organizations currently operating online that would benefit from another revenue source. Anyone who owns and operates a website, runs an active blog, or is involved within the mobile industry online can be a perfect candidate to partner with ComboApp and take part in this opportunity.</p>
							<h4>2. Target Audience</h4>
							<p>ComboApp's main client base consists of mobile app or Mac app developers, as well as anyone who owns and mobile brands or specific applications. Our Affiliate Reseller Program has been developed to attract these types of clients as effectively as possible.</p>
							<h4>3. How does it work?</h4>
							<p>Our prospective affiliates will not need to make any significant time or work commitments in order to be successful. ComboApp has ensured that taking part within our Marketing Services Reseller Program as easy and as hassle free to do as possible. ComboApp will provide our resellers with a full copy of our custom designed affiliate tracking code so that we can begin our partnership without undue work or time commitments. Our Affiliates simply copy and paste this code into their website and begin earning money from successfully referred costumers immediately. There is no fiscal investment of any kind that is required, nor are there any specific time commitments.</p>
							<h4>4. Commission Structure</h4>
							<p>We pay our partners 10% of all sales. Reseller is paid a commission as the percentage of the sale price. The minimum payment is $50 US. Any amount lower than this will be held in Resellers account until this minimum payment threshold is reached.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, to ensure that our affiliate partners are paid fairly and accurately, they are given unique promotional codes containing a 2% discount for their clients. This allows ComboApp – and not our reseller affiliates – to take charge of tracking referred customers effectively. Once a referred customer completes a purchase, our affiliates simply collect a percent of the sale income. ComboApp reseller affiliates do not execute any services other referring costumers to ComboApp. As an added incentive, referral bonuses to our top resellers are available as part of this exciting program as a way for us to recognize their work and extend our gratitude.</p>
