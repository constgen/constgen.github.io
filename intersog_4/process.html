				<!--Idea-->
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>Features selection and discussion with the client. Rough estimates of work content and expected velocity are done.</li>
						<li>At the first day of the sprint we arrange a Sprint Planning   Meeting to detect tasks that will be included in the iteration where we   create sub-tasks and plan out the tickets for our project management   system called Redmine.</li>
						<li>First week of the sprint will generally be devoted to the   implementation of new features while our QA and analysis teams are   preparing the necessary documentation for the next sprint and testing   sessions.</li>
						<li>The second week will be dedicated to testing and debugging, and   our QA engineers, analysts, and developers will tightly cooperate with   one another to maintain a stable and operational build of the   application.</li>
						<li>At the end of the iteration a Sprint Review/Retrospective   meeting will take place where our team as well as our clients discuss   their results and additional quality assurance criteria are figured in   as well.</li>
						<li>Our Agile approach and scrum-based methodology are outstanding   tools which help us to deploy working application prototypes soon as   possible, always emphasizing client feedback, high development quality,   as well as cost-effectiveness.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<!--Analysis-->
				<div>
					We believe that every stage of our projects are equally important to   execute effectively to ensure positive outcomes, and we take a lot of   effort to execute each step of development correctly. However, it's very   difficult to manage projects without proper documentation and that's   why the analysis stage, which includes user experience insurance,   application prototyping, and documentation creation, remains one of the   most important stages for correctly starting most projects. In the   beginning we bring together interactive mock-ups, prototypes whose main   goal is to form the design and navigation bases, and to make your   application feel and look great at completion. Our analysis and QA teams   will work with our clients to figure out their target user's needs and   preferences, and create the most valuable outcome accordingly. As a   client, you can expect the creation of user stories or 'use-cases', as   well as prototyping and wire frame development at this stage. This won't   be a polished graphic user interface quite yet, but only draft to get   first impressions and to help our clients to start forming more informed   opinions about their project. This stage is very important for the   project's future in general, and its a stage that's never underestimated   at Intersog.
				</div>
				<!--Development-->
				<div>
					After the final planning and documentation aspects of your project are complete, we begin coding. We utilize Scrum and Agile practices so that the development process is divided into separate periods with shorter time-frames called sprints. Each sprint usually takes around two weeks of pure development, with an analysis stage that starts at the end of each iteration. During this stage our analysis and QA teams create all the necessary artifacts and documentation, such as user stories and test-cases. The integration phase is often only begun at the very end of a sprint cycle and may last up to one week.
				</div>
				<!--Testing-->
				<div>
					These entities will be either similar or dissimilar depending on if we're gearing development for several platforms or applications or not. Using this documentation as a basis, our specialists create a Test Plan which outlines the responsibilities of the QA team, and arrangements with managers and the development team. Further into the development of this document smoke tests are created as well. Smoke tests include several test cases which when taken together cover the full breadth of  the tested system's general functionality. Smoke tests, test cases, and additional entities will incorporate all requirements and basic specifications fully.
				</div>
				<!--Publishing-->
				<div>
					<div>
						<p>Utilizing our experience in application development as well as   the promotion of our own product catalog, the Intersog team would be   glad to provide not only the aforementioned services but also publishing   and marketing services with the help of our strategic partner - the   ComboApp Marketing &amp; PR Agency.</p>
						<p>Being part of the iPhone Developer Program, we at Intersog have   immediate access to our App Store account and this means that you don't   need to apply for membership when releasing content to the App Store if   you don't want to. We'll take care of it by ourselves and will make sure   deployment is completed smoothly and the content is promptly released   to countless iPhone users from around the world. However, we realize   that a lot our our customers might desire to become members of the   iPhone Developer Program themselves, in which case we'll gladly help in   opening this account and submitting an application as well.</p>
						<p>Besides the iOS marketplace we also utilize market distribution   software for Android platforms including their official Google market,   and would be happy to grant your application access to this market via   our software as well. The good news is that you won't need to wait very   long for application approval and publishing moderation. In a matter of   days your application will be ready for sale.</p>
						<p>Of course, we are also able to help our clients submit their   applications to the RIM and W7 marketplaces as well, as we've had a   number of projects developed for these platforms as well.</p>
