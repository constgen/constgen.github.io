				<summary><h3>How to start with your idea?</h3><a href="#">More</a></summary>
				<article>
					<p> If you have a great idea that you'd like to use as the basis of   an application the first thing you need to consider is who your target   audience will be and business model you'll utilize to monetize your app.   Based on this information, you will be able to select the ideal   platform(s) for your future project and decide from there whether you   will develop your app specifically for the iPhone,iPad, Android, or   Blackberry platform -- or if you'll develop your app across multiple   platforms. This decision will affect the development price, development   speed, which type of graphic resources will be required for development.   After this you should draft a comprehensive outline of your application   idea and it's proposed functionality. It is always greatly beneficial   to us if you create functional app specifications, a concise   description, together with a clear visual representation of how you   envision your application will look like.</p>
					<p>You can outsource these tasks or limit your direct involvement   to one of the aforementioned steps and let our development team deal   with the rest. However, without a clear understanding of your project   objectives and your app's functionality the analytical stage of   development will last much longer. Furthermore various development and   implementation risks will be eventually be much higher and the   development process as a whole will require much more effort and   attention from both sides.</p>
					<p>Make sure that you set realistic budgetary parameters for your   project and get accurate quotes from the development companies you   approach to critique against your planned budget. Please remember that   if you set a fixed budget for development vendors may suggest that you   exclude some features or functionalities from your application to ensure   that it's development fits your budget. </p>

				<article>
					<p>To hire a professional development company you will need to ask a   lot of questions about their business operations and look closely at   development process descriptions. Always ask yourself critical questions   like: Do they have enough experience to meet my needs?</p>
					<p>Check the portfolio of the vendor and revise graphics,   user-interface, and overall quality. Request to test one their completed   products before you whether or not to hire them. After you've made your   final decision you should provide as many details about your project as   possible and establish communication channels with your chosen   developer that is convenient, open, reliable, and effective.</p>
					<p>Don't forget to sign a full non-disclosure agreement (NDA) prior   to beginning any development work. This measure will protect your   intellectual property rights and establish a formally confidential tone   for all future communications.</p>
					<p>Be precise about what development timeline you expect to follow,   as well as what functionalities you expect to be delivered or completed   first. It's very important to let your development company know about   your future business plans and deadline expectations as it will help   them create a concrete project management plan and allow them to set   specific milestones for progressing through your project. Be sure to   communicate these business plans and your timeline together with your   expectations in written form prior to the start of project development   to maintain maximum clarity on both ends.</p>
					<p>Once development begins, prepare yourself to work through a   large amount of different iterations, bugs, and questions from   developers that need answering. These are things which are invariably   present in any development project, remember that if bugs are found at   the development stage it's much better than discovering them after your   application launches to the public. This form trail-and-error   development will lead ultimately lead to more profits and higher   customer satisfaction with your end product. To ensure that this happens   though, you'll need to stay involved throughout the whole development   process from beginning to end. Always remember, its your application.   Also realize that after your project's scope is settled upon, all   additional functionalities that you would like to include will be   charged an extra premium over the project's original budget.</p>
					<p>We recommend that you create a specific payment structure for   your project's development, for example: Offer milestone payments with   25% of project cost paid to begin development, another 25% paid after   first your app's first version is completed, another 25% after the beta   version is completed, and the remaining 25% at the end of the project   when your app is fully done.</p>
